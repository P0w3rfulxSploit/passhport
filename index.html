<p>Passhport is designed to provide you an easy way to manage adminsys access through all your servers. Also, it helps to monitor the activities on servers, including the classical "WWWW" informations: Who, When, What, Why.
Every connection is logged with the name of the adminsys, the date, a comment from the adminsys to describe why he has connected (optionnal) and an history of the commands he used.</p>

<p>If you want to take back your servers control, Passhport is made for you. And guess what... It's opens source.</p>

<p>Passhport has to be installed on a server between adminsys and production servers. When someone want to connect, he pass through passhport and all his accreditations are checked. If he is allowed, he connect flawless and can works as usual.
Passhport can easily be load-balanced betweeen multiple servers to avoid any SPOF... but you can also use it on a single server or even a easy to reload virtual machine.</p>

<p>Passhport contains two programs, the server who take care of almost everything. Named <code>passhportd</code> he start as daemon and provide a REST API used by the client.
The client <code>passhport</code> is used to manage users and servers access using the REST API from the server.</p>

<p>Today passhport is in a very early stage. It's not usable at all. We aim to be ready to ship a first version by the end of this summer 2015.</p>
